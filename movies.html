    <h2>A Few Good Men</h2>

    <p>This film is one of my all time favorites for two reasons- the plot, and the actors. The plot is amazing - lead by Tom Cruise is a military lawyer who is defending two soliders who are accused of murdering a Marine in Cuba. This case is very hard to
    defend, considering one of the lawyers friend suggests that the murder of the Marine was done because of the order of a Colonel to the soldiers, and the soldiers were merely doing their job in order to stay Marines themselves. Colonel is played by Jack
    Nicholson, and the friends of the lawyer are played by Demi Moore and Kevin Pollack. The suspense of this movie is great, and the thought process that Tom Cruise uses to beat this case is very detailed and creative. </p>
    <h3>The Truman Show</h3>

    <p>The Truman Show is another one of my all time favorites because of the new concept of television that it implies. Truman is a man who has lived his whole life not knowing he is being recorded into television for everything he does. Since his 
    birth, Truman was being watched by millions of his every move and step of growing up. Truman himself does not know this, and he thinks he lives a normal life. Little does he know that everything, from the people, family, friends, houses, neighbors, 
    and even the city was created just for him so that he could think it was his real life. However, as Truman grows older, he begins to senses some odd off feeling about his town and life, and wants to travel abroad. But since there is no abroad in this 
    built city, Truman questions his very own existence and everything he thought was real. Truman is played by Jim Carrey, who does a phenomenal job of acting throughout this film. It is certainly one of his most underrated films, along with Eternal Sunshine 
    of the Spotless Mind.  </p>
    <h3>You've Got Mail</h3>

    <p>You've Got Mail is a classical rom-com movie that stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Both are amazing actors who played in a rom-com movie before, known as Sleepless in Seattle. This movie is just as great, but I personally grew up with You've Got Mail
    throughout my childhood. This movie is about a bookstore owner and a corporate business man who are rivals in real life but lovers online. However, they do not know each others identity online, so they have no idea that it is each other in real life.
    Strangely enough they start realizing online that the person they are talking to has similar characteristics of someone else in real life. How they figure out about each other is what makes this movie hilarious and interesting at the same time. I
    recommend this movie as a cozy, fall sit down movie with a little bit of humor and business.
